# WIN

A (soon to be) RESTful API for WFU WIN. Built ontop of Redis, scrapes WFU WIN for requested data.

Stay tuned. Full build and documentation/examples will be released soon.

As of right now, the following methods are working:

`internal directory`
`student schedule`
`changing term`

Currently, data is being pushed through the entire stack. (This is still very, very, premature) Check it out:
